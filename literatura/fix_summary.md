# Spring Boot Application Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was failing to start with the following error:
```
APPLICATION FAILED TO START

Description:
Field libroRepo in service.BibliotecaService required a bean of type 'repository.LibroRepository' that could not be found.
```

## Root Cause
Spring Boot was not properly detecting the repository interfaces in the `repository` package. This was because:

1. The application was missing explicit configuration to tell Spring where to find JPA repositories
2. The entity scanning was not properly configured

## Solution Implemented
Added the following annotations to the main application class (`LiteraturaApplication.java`):

1. `@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = "repository")` - Explicitly tells Spring where to find repository interfaces
2. `@EntityScan(basePackages = "model")` - Explicitly tells Spring where to find entity classes

## Code Changes

```java
// Before
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {"com.literatura.literatura", "console", "service", "repository", "model"})
public class LiteraturaApplication {
    // ...
}

// After
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {"com.literatura.literatura", "console", "service", "repository", "model"})
@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = "repository")
@EntityScan(basePackages = "model")
public class LiteraturaApplication {
    // ...
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **Package Structure**: Consider reorganizing your packages to follow Spring Boot conventions. Typically, all packages should be under a common root package (e.g., `com.literatura.literatura`).

2. **Component Scanning**: When using non-standard package structures, always explicitly configure component scanning with annotations like `@EnableJpaRepositories` and `@EntityScan`.

3. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling in the service layer, especially for database operations.

4. **Testing**: Add integration tests to verify that Spring Boot correctly initializes all components.
